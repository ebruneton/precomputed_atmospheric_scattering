/*<h2>atmosphere/model.h</h2>

<p>This file defines the API to use our atmosphere model in OpenGL applications.
To use it:
<ul>
<li>create a <code>Model</code> instance with the desired atmosphere
parameters.</li>
<li>call <code>Init</code> to precompute the atmosphere textures,</li>
<li>link <code>GetShader</code> with your shaders that need access to the
atmosphere shading functions.</li>
<li>for each GLSL program linked with <code>GetShader</code>, call
<code>SetProgramUniforms</code> to bind the precomputed textures to this
program (usually at each frame).</li>
<li>delete your <code>Model</code> when you no longer need its shader and
precomputed textures (the destructor deletes these resources).</li>
</ul>

<p>The shader returned by <code>GetShader</code> provides the following
functions (that you need to forward declare in your own shaders to be able to
compile them separately):

<pre class="prettyprint">
// Returns the radiance of the Sun, outside the atmosphere.
vec3 GetSolarRadiance();

// Returns the sky radiance along the segment from 'camera' to the nearest
// atmosphere boundary in direction 'view_ray', as well as the transmittance
// along this segment.
vec3 GetSkyRadiance(vec3 camera, vec3 view_ray, double shadow_length,
    vec3 sun_direction, out vec3 transmittance);

// Returns the sky radiance along the segment from 'camera' to 'p', as well as
// the transmittance along this segment.
vec3 GetSkyRadianceToPoint(vec3 camera, vec3 p, double shadow_length,
    vec3 sun_direction, out vec3 transmittance);

// Returns the sun and sky irradiance received on a surface patch located at 'p'
// and whose normal vector is 'normal'.
vec3 GetSunAndSkyIrradiance(vec3 p, vec3 normal, vec3 sun_direction,
    out vec3 sky_irradiance);

// Returns the luminance of the Sun, outside the atmosphere.
vec3 GetSolarLuminance();

// Returns the sky luminance along the segment from 'camera' to the nearest
// atmosphere boundary in direction 'view_ray', as well as the transmittance
// along this segment.
vec3 GetSkyLuminance(vec3 camera, vec3 view_ray, double shadow_length,
    vec3 sun_direction, out vec3 transmittance);

// Returns the sky luminance along the segment from 'camera' to 'p', as well as
// the transmittance along this segment.
vec3 GetSkyLuminanceToPoint(vec3 camera, vec3 p, double shadow_length,
    vec3 sun_direction, out vec3 transmittance);

// Returns the sun and sky illuminance received on a surface patch located at
// 'p' and whose normal vector is 'normal'.
vec3 GetSunAndSkyIlluminance(vec3 p, vec3 normal, vec3 sun_direction,
    out vec3 sky_illuminance);
</pre>

<p>where
<ul>
<li><code>camera</code> and <code>p</code> must be expressed in a reference
frame where the planet center is at the origin, and measured in the unit passed
to the constructor's <code>length_unit_in_meters</code> argument.
<code>camera</code> can be in space, but <code>p</code> must be inside the
atmosphere,</li>
<li><code>view_ray</code>, <code>sun_direction</code> and <code>normal</code>
are unit direction vectors expressed in the same reference frame (with
<code>sun_direction</code> pointing <i>towards</i> the Sun),</li>
<li><code>shadow_length</code> is the length along the segment which is in
shadow, measured in the unit passed to the constructor's
<code>length_unit_in_meters</code> argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>and where
<ul>
<li>the first 4 functions return spectral radiance and irradiance values
(in $W.m^{-2}.sr^{-1}.nm^{-1}$ and $W.m^{-2}.nm^{-1}$), at the 3 wavelengths
<code>kLambdaR</code>, <code>kLambdaG</code>, <code>kLambdaB</code> (in this
order),</li>
<li>the other functions return luminance and illuminance values (in
$cd.m^{-2}$ and $lx$) in linear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">
sRGB</a> space (i.e. before adjustements for gamma correction),</li>
<li>all the functions return the (unitless) transmittance of the atmosphere
along the specified segment at the 3 wavelengths <code>kLambdaR</code>,
<code>kLambdaG</code>, <code>kLambdaB</code> (in this order).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note</b> The precomputed atmosphere textures can store either irradiance
or illuminance values (see the <code>num_precomputed_wavelengths</code>
parameter):
<ul>
  <li>when using irradiance values, the RGB channels of these textures contain
  spectral irradiance values, in $W.m^{-2}.nm^{-1}$, at the 3 wavelengths
  <code>kLambdaR</code>, <code>kLambdaG</code>, <code>kLambdaB</code> (in this
  order). The API functions returning radiance values return these precomputed
  values (times the phase functions), while the API functions returning
  luminance values use the approximation described in
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04336.pdf">A Qualitative and Quantitative
  Evaluation of 8 Clear Sky Models</a>, section 14.3, to convert 3 radiance
  values to linear sRGB luminance values.</li>
  <li>when using illuminance values, the RGB channels of these textures contain
  illuminance values, in $lx$, in linear sRGB space. These illuminance values
  are precomputed as described in
  <a href="http://www.oskee.wz.cz/stranka/uploads/SCCG10ElekKmoch.pdf">Real-time
  Spectral Scattering in Large-scale Natural Participating Media</a>, section
  4.4 (i.e. <code>num_precomputed_wavelengths</code> irradiance values are
  precomputed, and then converted to sRGB via a numerical integration of this
  spectrum with the CIE color matching functions). The API functions returning
  luminance values return these precomputed values (times the phase functions),
  while <i>the API functions returning radiance values are not provided</i>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The concrete API definition is the following:
